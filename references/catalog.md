# Skill and repository source catalog

## Acknowledgement and provenance

This toolkit is an original composition and integration layer, not a replacement or official distribution of the upstream projects. It is inspired by and selectively inherits workflow ideas, conventions, and tool roles from the projects listed below. Their licenses and contribution guidelines remain authoritative. The toolkit keeps the upstream links so every component can be traced back to its source.

The main workflow is based on ideas from [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills). The specification-oriented profile is informed by [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). The audit stages combine established open-source tools rather than reimplementing them.
