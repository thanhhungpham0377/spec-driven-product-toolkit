# Spec-Driven Product Toolkit

Use this skill when the user wants to develop a product from explicit specifications through implementation, verification, and release. The toolkit supports `prototype`, `balanced`, and `production` profiles.

Ask a short decision interview before installing. Determine project size, whether data/auth/payment is involved, whether UI is user-facing, whether migrations/deployments are involved, and whether CI/PR gates are required. Recommend one profile, explain the trade-off, and wait for confirmation before changing the target repository.

Read [references/profiles.md](references/profiles.md) for the interview, stage behavior, and profile matrix. Read [references/catalog.md](references/catalog.md) when the user asks what a component does or where it came from.

Run `scripts/install_profile.py` from this skill directory. It writes only the selected toolkit under the target repository's `.spec-product/`, creates one non-overlapping manifest, and generates adapters only for tools in the selected profile.

```powershell
python scripts/install_profile.py --target D:\path\to\repo --profile balanced --check-only
python scripts/install_profile.py --target D:\path\to\repo --profile balanced
python scripts/install_profile.py --target D:\path\to\repo --profile production --install-tools
```

`--install-tools` is opt-in because it can invoke package managers and network access. Without it, the installer performs a preflight and emits exact missing-tool commands. Never install two overlapping workflow orchestrators; the manifest chooses Matt Pocock as the workflow layer and uses Spec Kit only in production for large, specification-heavy work.

After installation, use `.spec-product/README.md`, `.spec-product/manifest.json`, and `.spec-product/source-catalog.md` as the source of truth. Report missing tools or failed gates instead of claiming the project is verified.

This toolkit is an original composition inspired by and selectively integrating ideas from upstream projects. It is not an official distribution of Matt Pocock skills, Spec Kit, or any audit tool. Consult `references/catalog.md` for attribution, provenance, and source links.
